## General info

Starting with the Google app store dataset, you will import the data into Python and create a notebook with your analysis to design a new app.
You want to embark on the creation of your first app, but first you want to identify the right industry. You decide to take a data-driven approach, so you download data from the entire Google app store. In this dataset (available at this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) you have for each app the rating, reviews, number of installs, type (paid or free), price and category.
Imagine now that you have to choose how to structure your app. Starting with this data, try describing the dataset and analysing the correlations between variables, outliers, categories where there is more competition and those where there is more interest. Finally, try to propose your own strategy for your app. 
Make sure, however, that you first explore the data thoroughly and show your reasoning.
With the dataset, you will have to import the data into Python and create a notebook with your analysis.
There are no strict instructions, but make sure you do a good exploration of the dataset and the correlation between the variables. 
Try to formulate hypotheses and test them, keeping in mind the goal of helping key stakeholders to fully understand the industry in which they operate and to formulate appropriate strategies.
